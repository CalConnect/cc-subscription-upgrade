== Header Field: Sync-Token

This specification defines a new header field Sync-Token for use by
the enhanced GET method.

[source]
----
    Sync-Token = DQUOTE URI DQUOTE
----

The value MUST be a URI which could be a data URI.
The synchronization token itself MUST be treated as an "opaque"
string by the client, i.e., the actual string data has no specific
meaning or syntax. These restrictions align the specification with
<<RFC6578, section=3.2>>.
