[abstract]
This specification introduces an approach to allow subscribers to
calendar feeds to upgrade to a more performant protocol.

This specification updates RFC5545 to add the value DELETED to the
STATUS property.

This specification also adds values to the Preferences
Registry defined in RFC7240 to add the subscribe-enhanced-get and
limit preferences and to the link relations directory
defined in RFC8288.
