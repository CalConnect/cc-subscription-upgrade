== Discovering alternative access methods

The advertising of other access points is achieved through the use of
the LINK header as defined in <<RFC5988>>.  New link relation types are
defined in this specification - each being associated with a protocol
or protocol subset.

These LINK headers will be delivered when a client carries out a HEAD
request targeting the URL of the resource.


[example]
--
This is an example of a HEAD request and the response from a server
that supports the enhanced GET method.

----
    >> Request <<

    HEAD /caldata/events.ics HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: text/calendar

    >> Response <<

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: xxxx
    Link: <http://example.com/subscribe/events.ics>;
                 rel="subscribe-enhanced-get"

Note that the target for an upgraded service may be the same as
for the initial resource.
