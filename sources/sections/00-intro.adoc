== Introduction

Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an iCalendar file which is
often published as a resource accessible using the unofficial
'webcal' scheme.

The only available option for updating that resource is the usual
HTTP polling of cached resources using Etags.

There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see a timely
response to changes and servers not wishing to be overloaded by
frequent requests for possibly large amounts of data.

This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can
discover a more performant access method.  Given the location of the
resource as an iCalendar file, the client can perfom a HEAD request on the
resource and inspect the returned headers which will offer a number
of alternative access methods.

Given that many clients and servers already support CalDAV this provides an easy
upgrade path for those clients.  CalDAV and DAV subsets are specified
here to allow lighter weight implementations.
