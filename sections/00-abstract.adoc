[abstract]
This specification introduces an approach to allow subscribers to
calendar feeds to upgrade to a more performant protocol.

This specification updates <<RFC5545>> to add the value DELETED to the
STATUS property.

This specification also updates <<RFC7240>> to add the subscribe-
enhanced-get and limit preferences.
